            faults
            cannot yet deserue such hatefull reuenge, thy dayes are too short for so sharpe a doome, but thy vntimely
            death must pay thy mothers debtes, and her guiltlesse crime must be thy gastly curse. And shalt thou sweete
            babe be committed to fortune? When thou art alreadie spighted by fortune: shall the seas be thy harbour, and
            the hard boate thy cradle? Shall thy tender mouth in steede of sweete kisses, be nipped with bitter stormes?
            Shalt thou haue [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1496–7</span></span>] the whistling winds
            for thy Lullabie, and the salt sea fome in steed of [<span class="tln">tln

            hap? What father would be so cruell? Or
            what gods wil not reuenge such rigor? Let me kisse thy lips (sweet infant) and wet thy tender cheekes with
            my
            teares, and put this chaine <b>[C1, 1592]</b> about thy litle necke, that if fortune saue thee, it may helpe
            to
            succour thee. Thus, since thou must go to surge in the gastfull seas, with a sorrowfull kisse I bid thee
            farewell, and I pray the Gods thou mayst fare well. Such, and so great was her griefe, that her vital
            spirits
            being suppressed with sorrow, she fell downe in a traunce, hauing her sences so sotted with care, that after
            she was reuiued, yet she lost her memorie, and lay for a great time without mouing as one in a traunce. The
            gard left her in this perplexitie, and caried the child to the king, who quite <b>[C1, 1588]</b> deuoide of
            pity,
            commanded that without delay it should bee put in the boat, hauing neither saile nor other to guid it, and

            to bee carried into the midst of the sea, and there left to the wind and waue as [<span

                class="tln-digits">1173</span></span>] hee called her for the more
            reproch into open Court, where it was obiected against her, that she had committed adulterie with Egistus,
            and
            conspired with Franion to poyson Pandosto her husband, but [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1191–5</span></span>]
            their pretence being partely spyed,
            shee counselled them to flie away by night for their better safety. Bellaria, who standing like a prisoner
            at
            the Barre, feeling in her selfe a cleare Conscience to withstand her false accusers: seeing that no lesse
            then
            death could pacifie her husbands wrath, waxed bolde, and desired that she might haue Lawe and Iustice, for
            mercy shee neyther craued nor hoped for, and that those periured wretches, which had falsly accused her to
            the
            King, might be brought before her face, to giue in euidence. [<span class="orange-link">F1</span>] But Pandosto, whose rage and Iealousie was
            such, as no reason, nor equitie could appease: tolde her, that for her accusers they were of such credite,
            as
            their wordes were sufficient witnesse, and that the sodaine and secret flight of Egistus, and Franion
            confirmed that which they had confessed: and as for her, it was her parte to deny such a monstrus crime, and
            to be impudent in forswearing the [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1263</span></span>] fact,
            since [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1229–32</span></span>] shee had past all shame in
            committing
            the fault: but her stale countenaunce should stand for no coyne, for as the Bastard which <b>[C1<sup>v</sup>]</b> she bare was
            serued, so she should with some cruell death be requited. Bellaria no whit dismayed with this rough reply,
            [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1196–1228</span></span>] tolde her Husband Pandosto, that he
            spake vpon choller, and not conscience: for [<span class="tln">tln <span

            her vertuous life had beene euer such, as no spot of suspition could euer staine. And if she had borne a
            frendly countenaunce<sup class="in-text">13</sup> to Egistus, it was in respect he was his friende, and not for any lusting affection:
            therefore if she were condemned without any further proofe, [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1293</span></span>]
            it was rigour, and not Law. The noble
            men which sate in iudgement, said that Bellaria spake reason, and intreated the king that the accusers might
            be openly examined, and sworne, and if then the euidence were such, as the Iury might finde her guilty (for
            seeing she was a Prince,<sup class="in-text">14</sup> she ought to be tryed by her peeres)<sup class="in-text">15</sup> then let her haue such punishment as the
            extremitie of the Law will assigne to such malefactors. The king presently made answere, that in this case
            he
            might, and would dispence with the Law, and that the Iury being once panneld, they should take his word for
            sufficient euidence, otherwise he would make the proudest of them repent it. The noble men seeing the king
            in
            choler were all whist, but Bellaria, whose life then hung in the ballaunce, [<span class="tln">tln <span

            perpetuall infamie, then momentarie death, tolde the king, if his furie might stand for a Law, that it were
            vaine to haue the Iury yeeld their verdit, and therefore she fell downe vpon her knees, and desired the king
            that for the loue he bare16 to his young sonne Garinter, whome she brought into the world, that hee woulde
