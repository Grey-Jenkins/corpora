            <h3 class="fluid-type-0">Lara Hansen, Co-Editor of the New Variorum _Richard III_</h3>
            <p class="fluid-type--1">Lara Hansen earned her BS, MA, and PhD from the University of Nevada, Reno. Her
              academic studies have been primarily focused on Textual Studies of the Early Modern period. Her interest
              in textual studies began early in her graduate studies with a course which concentrated on rare books and
              bibliographic description. She spent a year working in UNR’s Black Rock Press learning the art of
              letterpress printing and Book Arts. Shortly thereafter She met Dr. Eric Rasmussen who introduced her to
              editorial theory which ratcheted her love for rare books and print shop practices to a whole other
              level.</p>
            <p class="fluid-type--1">Working with Eric has given her the rare opportunity to work directly on several
              textual related projects. Lara collated several editions for the Hamlet Variorum edition. Her first
              research trip was to Duke Humfrey’s Library at Oxford to compare editions of the quarto of The Two Noble
              Kinsmen and Cynthia’s Revels in order to inventory print variants. Working with the initial research team
              on The Shakespeare First Folios: Descriptive Catalogue (Palgrave Macmillan 2012), she developed the
              research model which allowed her to use the data for her dissertation. Lara’s doctoral thesis traced the
              patterns of First Folio watermarks and presence of uncorrected page states to posit practices of the
              Jaggards’ print house. She has since continued her textual work with courses in descriptive bibliography
              and book collecting from the California Rare Book School (2010 and 2014) and papers for the Shakespeare
              Association of America (2016) and the World Shakespeare Congress (2016).</p>
            <p class="fluid-type--1">In addition to Lara’s academic preparation, she has twenty years experience in
              computer support. She used her skills in this area to contribute to data collection methods and
              presentation of her research. She has worked closely with Dr. Mark Farnsworth on several projects in the
              past and for this current proposal. They have variorum experience and they bring a good deal of respect
              and enthusiasm for the task necessary to complete the New Variorum Richard the Third.</p>
